                <h2>Fullstack software developer</h2>
                <p>I love new challanges and cliches. My main goal is to become the best with my loyal friends without hurting any rights of the Pokemon community.</p>
                <p> I also love cats but I live between two roads with incredible traffic and I couldn't bear the loosing of a loyal companion like this. So I stick to Pokemon fights and stuff.</p>

                    <dt>Instruction set</dt>
                    <dd>All computers run using very low-level commands which do some very basic functions, such aas reading data, writing data, jumping to adresses, and calculating basic arithmetic. The complete list of commands that can be run by a CPU is known as that instruction set.</dd>
                
                    <dt>Computer</dt>
                    <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</dd>

                    <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>

                    <dt>Random Access Memory (RAM)</dt>
                    <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</dd>

                    <dt>Programing language</dt>
                    <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</dd>

                    <dt>Domain Name System (DNS)</dt>
                    <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities.</dd>
